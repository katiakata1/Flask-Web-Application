# My Flask Application

This is my first serious project, which required me to overcome many challenges and keep going despite
the external pressure and wide range of objectives to deliver. 

The project idea was to create an responsive application serving a cleaning industry, where the 
employee/cleaner could login into the system and request the supplies from the manager needed 
to deliver the best cleaning experience. While working as a communal area cleaning associate I came across with 
an unreasonable need of contacting the manager on regular basis in order to inform him/her of the shortage of cleaning 
supplies. In most of the cases, the wrong supplies were ordered and delivered to the cleaner, rising a conflict between 
the manager and the employee. 

The current flask application is the prototype usefull for small cleaning companies, that would help to reduce time 
communicated with a manager about the supplies and increase the efficiency of cleaners work. Instead of personally contacting 
the manager, the cleaning associate could login into the system, see what requests he/she made in the past and add, update and
delete the requests.

The main points were considered, while desinging the application:
 - Front end design using FLask framework, python coding language and Jinja template engine
 - CRUD functionality ensuring ADD, UPDATE and DELETE functionalities
 - Working connection between the user input and Flask-Mysql database saving the request 
 - Set of tests (Unittest) checking the functionality of the application
